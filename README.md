## Introduction
 Welcome to the [DARA Big Data](https://www.darabigdata.com) project [International Data Week 2018](http://internationaldataweek.org) hackathon at the University of Botswana! <img src="https://github.com/darabigdata/IDWBotswana/blob/master/media/Animated-Flag-Botswana.gif" width=5%>

The DARA Big Data hackathon is designed to help you improve your data science skills in a friendly and supportive environment. At the hackathon, each team will choose one of the DARA Big Data hack challenges to work on. At the end of the hack each team will give a 5 minute presentation. These presentations will be judged by the organisers and there will be a prize for the winning team. The presentations will be judged on the accuracy of the predicted results via machine learning and visualisation/presentation of the data/results.

The DARA Big Data hack challenges will be run in Python3 using the [IDIA Cloud](idia.ac.za/research-and-projects/african-research-cloud). Students should have a basic working knowledge of Python (including the scipy and numpy libraries) - but you do not have to be an expert to take part and enjoy yourself!

## Challenge 1: Build a machine learning recommendation engine web application

Machine Learning can be used to provide awesome applications and services. Examples are recommender systems on Netflix, Amazon and even Google reverse Image search. However, creating an application isn't limited to big tech firms. In this challenge you will build a web application of your choice.

## Challenge 2: Build a machine learning image classifier using web-scraped data

In this challenge you will learn how to web scrape images from Google and use them to train/test an image-based Machine Learning classifier. The aim is to come up with a image classification problem (cats vs dogs, people vs trees, Trump vs an orange cheeto etc), build your own database for training the algorithm by web-scraping the images and then to use machine learning for the classification.

## Challenge 3: Build a machine learning music classification system

This project is all about using python to extract features from audio waveforms, and to then run machine learning algorithms to cluster and quantify music.
