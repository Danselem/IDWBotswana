# Challenge 3: Build a machine learning music classification system

Music recommendation systems are all over the internet, from Spotify to iTunes. But how do they know what music you will like? For this challenge you build a machine learning application that classifies music using the content of the individual tracks. Your application could make recommendations for individuals, or it could suggest musical tracks that would be good in films, or it could automatically identify artists, or it could do something else! The choice is up to you. 

### What's in the repo?

* **Extract_Features.ipynb**
    * *A jupyter notebook that uses the librosa library to extract machine learning features from audio files*
* **Music_Classifier.ipynb**
    * *A jupyter notebook that implements simple machine learning to classify music*
* **data_5band**
    * *A folder containing files with machine learning features for different artists/bands*
* **data_5and25band**
    * *A folder containing files with machine learning features for different artists/bands*
